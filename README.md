This code creates a "Pipe" class to contain the properties of a physical pipe, a "Fluid" class to contain the relevant properties of a fluid. The "Pipe" class uses a fluid flow rate and the "Fluid" class to calculate the pressure loss in the pipe represented by the pipe object. The "main" function provides a command-line interface so that this portion of code can run be run without the GUI.
